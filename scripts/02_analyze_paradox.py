# Import necessary libraries
# Import utility functions for network analysis

# Load network data from outputs/networks/

# For each node:
# - Compute its degree (number of friends)
# - Compute the average degree of its neighbors

# Compare each node's degree to the average degree of its neighbors
# - Count how many nodes satisfy the friendship paradox
# - Calculate statistical metrics (e.g., percentage of nodes affected)

# Save the analysis results to outputs/analysis_results.csv
